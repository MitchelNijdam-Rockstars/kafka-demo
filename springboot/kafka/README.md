# Example Spring Boot project with Kafka
Simply to demonstrate the ease of use of Kafka within Spring boot.

## Get started
Make sure to change the `bootstrap-servers` configuration to point to the ip of your brokers.
In production, make sure all brokers are configured there, so there is a backup ip in case of failure of one of the brokers.
